# JSP Parser
This parser is done partially to fulfill the requirements of a small online application you can find at (www.bilmenu.com).

The parsing and organization was initially done through the device, yet since that would take some seconds, I decided to do the parse and collect part on the fly and only receive the end organized result on the end device. This reduced the app load time severely. 
You can check this parser at work at
